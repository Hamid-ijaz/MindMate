# Bidirectional Google Tasks Sync Implementation

## Summary

This implementation adds comprehensive bidirectional sync between your app and Google Tasks, with interval-based sync checking integrated into the notification system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Bidirectional Sync**
- **App → Google Tasks**: Already working (create, update, complete, uncomplete tasks)
- **Google Tasks → App**: Now implemented (import new tasks, update existing tasks, sync completion status)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging based on last modified timestamps

### 2. **Sync Direction Settings**
- **App → Google**: Only sync changes from app to Google Tasks
- **Google → App**: Only sync changes from Google Tasks to app  
- **Bidirectional**: Full two-way sync (default and recommended)
- **UI Control**: Selectable dropdown in settings (was previously disabled)

### 3. **Auto Sync & Interval Sync**
- **Auto Sync Toggle**: Real-time sync on task changes (now functional)
- **Interval Sync**: Background sync every 30 minutes via comprehensive check API
- **Smart Scheduling**: Only syncs users with auto-sync enabled or overdue interval

### 4. **Comprehensive Check Integration**
- Google Tasks sync integrated into `/api/notifications/comprehensive-check`
- Runs alongside push notifications and email digests
- Detailed logging and error reporting
- Respects sync direction and timing settings

## Key Components Modified

### 1. **Google Tasks Service** (`src/services/google-tasks.ts`)
- Enhanced `convertGoogleTaskToAppTask` method
- Proper handling of completion status and timestamps
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. **Google Tasks Sync Service** (`src/services/google-tasks-sync.ts`)
- Added `performIntervalSync` method for background sync
- Enhanced `mergeGoogleTaskToAppTask` with proper completion handling
- Improved bidirectional sync logic in `performSync`
- Better conflict detection and resolution

### 3. **Google Tasks Connections UI** (`src/components/google-tasks-connections.tsx`)
- **Sync Direction**: Now fully selectable with dropdown
- **Auto Sync**: Toggle now functional (was disabled)
- **Better UX**: Clear labels and descriptions for all options

### 4. **Sync API** (`src/app/api/google/sync/route.ts`)
- Support for internal requests from comprehensive check
- New `intervalSync` action for background sync
- Enhanced settings update handling (syncDirection, autoSync)

### 5. **Comprehensive Check API** (`src/app/api/notifications/comprehensive-check/route.ts`)
- New `processGoogleTasksSync` function
- Intelligent user filtering based on sync settings
- Detailed logging and progress tracking
- Integration with existing notification loop

### 6. **Firestore Service** (`src/lib/firestore.ts`)
- Fixed task update handling with proper `deleteField` usage
- Better serialization for undefined values
- Enhanced support for bidirectional updates

## How It Works

### Interval Sync Process
1. **Comprehensive Check** runs every 30 minutes (or as configured)
2. **User Filtering**: Only processes users with:
   - Google Tasks connected and sync enabled
   - Sync direction including `google-to-app` or `bidirectional`
   - Auto sync enabled OR last sync > 30 minutes ago
3. **Background Sync**: Calls interval sync for eligible users
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging based on modification timestamps
5. **Logging**: Detailed results included in comprehensive check response

### Real-Time Sync (Auto Sync)
- When enabled, task changes trigger immediate sync
- Works for both directions based on sync direction setting
- Respects user preferences and connection status

### Manual Sync
- "Sync Now" button for immediate full sync
- Useful for testing or when auto sync is disabled
- Shows progress and results in UI

## Configuration Options

### Sync Direction
- **App → Google**: `'app-to-google'` - Only push changes to Google Tasks
- **Google → App**: `'google-to-app'` - Only pull changes from Google Tasks  
- **Bidirectional**: `'bidirectional'` - Full two-way sync (recommended)

### Sync Timing
- **Auto Sync**: Real-time sync on task changes
- **Interval Sync**: Background sync every 30 minutes
- **Manual Sync**: On-demand sync via UI button

### Conflict Resolution
- **Last Modified Wins**: Tasks with newer timestamps take precedence
- **Completion Status**: Properly handles Google Tasks completion timestamps
- **Smart Merging**: Preserves important fields while updating changed ones

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Enable Bidirectional Sync**:
   - Go to Settings → Google Tasks Integration
   - Set Sync Direction to "Bidirectional"
   - Enable Auto Sync

2. **Test App → Google**:
   - Create/edit tasks in your app
   - Check Google Tasks to see changes

3. **Test Google → App**:
   - Create/edit tasks in Google Tasks
   - Wait for interval sync or trigger manual sync
   - Check your app for imported/updated tasks

4. **Test Comprehensive Check**:
   - Call `/api/notifications/comprehensive-check?mode=single`
   - Check logs for Google Tasks sync activity

## Monitoring

The comprehensive check now includes Google Tasks sync metrics:
- Users processed for sync
- Total tasks synced
- Sync errors and success logs
- Detailed timing and performance data

## Error Handling

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect Google API limits
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic handling of expired access tokens
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if some users fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error reporting and debugging info

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future releases:
- Real-time sync via webhooks (when Google Tasks supports it)
- Conflict resolution UI for manual conflict handling
- Sync statistics dashboard
- Advanced filtering options for selective sync
- Sync scheduling customization per user
