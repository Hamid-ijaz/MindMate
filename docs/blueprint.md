# **App Name**: Mindful Tasks

## Core Features:

- Task Details: Clean task management UI with task title, category tags, energy level, duration and timing metadata
- Task Suggestion: Suggest one task at a time. The system then displays prominent 'Yes', 'Not Now' and 'Don't Ask Again' buttons to streamline user interaction.
- Rejection Tracking: Tracks reasons for rejection in order to adaptively filter the most relevant future suggestions.
- Rejection Blackout: Avoids showing recently rejected tasks within a short time window. Escalates persistent rejections by prompting users to adjust the task.
- Task Rewording: A 'micro-task' tool suggests simplified actions if a task is overwhelming. For instance, converting a report into an outline.
- Chat check-ins: Daily prompts asking the user for a list of accomplished tasks for that day, in order to record accomplishments and guide future output.
