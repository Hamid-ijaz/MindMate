# Email Integration Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. UI Updates for Email Preferences
- ✅ Added `dailyDigest` field to EmailPreferences interface
- ✅ Added `dailyDigestTime` field to EmailPreferences interface  
- ✅ Updated default preferences to include daily digest settings
- ✅ Added Daily Digest toggle in the UI (after Weekly Digest)
- ✅ Added Daily Digest Time picker (conditional display when daily digest is enabled)
- ✅ Fixed user name reference (using firstName + lastName instead of user.name)

### 2. Comprehensive Check API Integration
- ✅ Added helper functions for sending daily and weekly digest emails
- ✅ Added logic to check if it's time to send daily digest (within 5 minutes of scheduled time)
- ✅ Added logic to check if it's time to send weekly digest (specified day at 9 AM ±5 minutes)
- ✅ Integrated email digest functionality into the existing comprehensive check loop
- ✅ Added email digest statistics tracking (dailyDigestsSent, weeklyDigestsSent, emailErrors)
- ✅ Respects quiet hours for email sending
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging for email operations

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Email Preferences UI Enhancements:
```typescript
interface EmailPreferences {
  // ... existing fields
  dailyDigest: boolean;        // ✅ NEW: Enable daily digest emails
  dailyDigestTime: string;     // ✅ NEW: Time for daily digest (e.g., "09:00")
}
```

### Comprehensive Check API Enhancements:
```typescript
// ✅ NEW: Helper functions for email digest integration
- sendDailyDigestForUser(userEmail)
- sendWeeklyDigestForUser(userEmail) 
- shouldSendDailyDigest(preferences, now)
- shouldSendWeeklyDigest(preferences, now)
```

### Smart Scheduling Logic:
- **Daily Digest**: Sends at user's preferred time (±5 minutes tolerance)
- **Weekly Digest**: Sends on user's chosen day at 9 AM (±5 minutes tolerance)
- **Quiet Hours**: Respects email quiet hours for both digest types
- **Frequency Control**: Prevents duplicate sends through existing comprehensive check logic

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Comprehensive Check API** runs every minute via GitHub Actions
2. **For Each User** with notification preferences:
   - Checks if it's time for daily digest based on `dailyDigestTime` preference
   - Checks if it's time for weekly digest based on `digestDay` preference  
   - Respects `quietHours` settings for email sending
   - Calls the respective digest API endpoints when conditions are met
   - Tracks success/failure statistics and logs results

3. **No Additional Cron Jobs** needed - everything integrates with existing infrastructure

## 📊 Statistics Tracking

The comprehensive check now tracks:
- `dailyDigestsSent`: Number of daily digests sent in current cycle
- `weeklyDigestsSent`: Number of weekly digests sent in current cycle  
- `emailErrors`: Number of email sending failures
- All existing notification statistics remain unchanged

## 🛠️ Configuration

Users can now configure:
- **Daily Digest**: Enable/disable + preferred time
- **Weekly Digest**: Enable/disable + preferred day  
- **Quiet Hours**: Applies to both digest types
- All settings available in the Email Preferences UI

## 🔐 Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if email APIs are unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging with user context
- Statistics tracking for monitoring email delivery success rates
- Quiet hours respected to avoid unwanted interruptions

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: No new cron jobs or infrastructure needed
2. **User Control**: Full customization of digest timing and preferences
3. **Reliable Delivery**: Built on existing robust notification infrastructure  
4. **Smart Scheduling**: Respects user preferences and quiet hours
5. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full statistics and error tracking
6. **Scalable**: Handles multiple users efficiently in single comprehensive check cycle

The implementation successfully integrates daily and weekly email digest functionality into the existing comprehensive notification check system, providing users with flexible, customizable email summaries while maintaining system efficiency and reliability.
